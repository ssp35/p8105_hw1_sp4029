### Problem 1

``` r
df <- tibble(
  rand_samp = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = rand_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("This", "is", "a", "character", "vector", "of", "length", "ten", "in", "df"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("green", "blue", "red", "green", "red", "green", "blue", "red", "green", "green"))
)
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 Ã— 4
    ##    rand_samp vec_logical vec_char  vec_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>     <fct>     
    ##  1     2.28  TRUE        This      green     
    ##  2     0.197 TRUE        is        blue      
    ##  3     0.606 TRUE        a         red       
    ##  4     0.185 TRUE        character green     
    ##  5    -0.451 FALSE       vector    red       
    ##  6    -0.213 FALSE       of        green     
    ##  7     0.797 TRUE        length    blue      
    ##  8     0.867 TRUE        ten       red       
    ##  9    -0.689 FALSE       in        green     
    ## 10    -0.129 FALSE       df        green

``` r
mean(pull(df, 1))
```

    ## [1] 0.344627

``` r
mean(pull(df, 2))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(df, 3))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, 3)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df, 4))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, 4)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Taking the mean of a numeric vector, such as the random sample from the
standard Normal distribution, and the logical vector works. Taking the
means of the character vector and the factor vector does not work.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df, 2))
as.numeric(pull(df, 3))
as.numeric(pull(df, 4))
```

The logical vector is converted into 1s and 0s because the vector is
binary, so R assigns the value 1 to TRUE and 0 to FALSE. The character
vector is converted into NAs because there is no way to assign a numeric
value to characters. The factor vector is converted into 1s, 2s, and 3s
because it is a factor with three levels, so R assigns a different value
to each level. These results explain what happens when trying to take
the mean. By treating the logical values as 1s and 0s, R is able to take
the mean. Since there are no numerical values associated with the
character vector, R is not able to take the mean. Even though there are
numerical values associated with each of the factor levels, R cannot
take the mean of the vector because the factor levels are treated as
characters.

### Problem 2

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The column names are: species, island, bill\_length\_mm,
bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g, sex, year.

Two important variables are species and island. The values in these
columns are: Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap and Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream
respectively.

The dataset spans the years 2007, 2008, 2009.

The size of the dataset is 344 x 8.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("bill_len_vs_flipper_len.pdf", height = 4, width = 4)
```
