### Problem 1

``` r
df <- tibble(
  rand_samp = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = rand_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("This", "is", "a", "character", "vector", "of", "length", "ten", "in", "df"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("green", "blue", "red", "green", "red", "green", "blue", "red", "green", "green"))
)
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 Ã— 4
    ##    rand_samp vec_logical vec_char  vec_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>     <fct>     
    ##  1   -0.275  FALSE       This      green     
    ##  2    0.279  TRUE        is        blue      
    ##  3    0.0598 TRUE        a         red       
    ##  4   -0.226  FALSE       character green     
    ##  5   -0.475  FALSE       vector    red       
    ##  6    2.30   TRUE        of        green     
    ##  7    0.905  TRUE        length    blue      
    ##  8    1.85   TRUE        ten       red       
    ##  9    1.56   TRUE        in        green     
    ## 10   -0.177  FALSE       df        green

``` r
mean(pull(df, 1))
```

    ## [1] 0.5802948

``` r
mean(pull(df, 2))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(df, 3))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, 3)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df, 4))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, 4)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Taking the mean of a numeric vector, such as the random sample from the
standard Normal distribution, and the logical vector works. Taking the
means of the character vector and the factor vector does not work.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df, 2))
as.numeric(pull(df, 3))
as.numeric(pull(df, 4))
```

The logical vector is converted into 1s and 0s because the vector is
binary, so R assigns the value 1 to TRUE and 0 to FALSE. The character
vector is converted into NAs because there is no way to assign a numeric
value to characters. The factor vector is converted into 1s, 2s, and 3s
because it is a factor with three levels, so R assigns a different value
to each level. These results explain what happens when trying to take
the mean. By treating the logical values as 1s and 0s, R is able to take
the mean. Since there are no numerical values associated with the
character vector, R is not able to take the mean. Even though there are
numerical values associated with each of the factor levels, R cannot
take the mean of the vector because the factor levels are treated as
characters.
